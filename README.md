# Styling-Pandas-Dataframes
1. The repositry contains a notebook in which you can find interesting stuff to style your pandas dataframes. <br/>
2. You can not find any styles that are applied to the dataframe just by viewing it in the console of Github. Try to open the document in either local Jupyter notebook or Google colab to have a look at the styles applied to the dataframe. <br/>
3. The notebook takes the diabetes dataset as the input and displays data prettier by applying styles to the dataframe. The dataset is available in the sklearn datasets module. You can use it or any other datasets that you have. <br/>
4. Feel free to reach out if you have any kind of doubts.
